# Conditional Statements

## Introduction

You have been tasked to build an application that will help users make choices. This activity will have you use conditional statements to make the choices for the users.

Recall the basic syntax for conditional statements

```
if (condition) {
    // do stuff here
} 
```

Recall that you can add  **else if**  and  **else**  statements to conditional statements for branching logic.

## Step 1 of Conditional Statements - Simple Conditionals

Alejandro wants to buy a new shirt. Create a program for him that checks the  **price**  and set the  **answer**variable to "Buying new shirt" if the shirt is under $20.

Run  `run-workflow step-01`  in your terminal to validate your work for step 1.

If all tests for the step are passing you will see  **BUILD SUCCESSFUL**  in your terminal window. If tests are failing you will see  **BUILD FAILED**  with the failing tests along with their messages in the output above.

You have completed this step when:

-   `run-workflow step-01`  passes with "BUILD SUCCESSFUL"

## Step 2 of Conditional Statements - Single Branch Conditionals

John wants to go for a jog. Create a program for him that will check the  **weather**  and set the  **answer**variable to "Going for a jog" if it is  _sunny_. Otherwise set the  **answer**  variable to "Not going for a jog".

Run  `run-workflow step-02`  in your terminal to validate your work for step 2.

If all tests for the step are passing you will see  **BUILD SUCCESSFUL**  in your terminal window. If tests are failing you will see  **BUILD FAILED**  with the failing tests along with their messages in the output above.

You have completed this step when:

-   `run-workflow step-02`  passes with "BUILD SUCCESSFUL"

## Step 3 of Conditional Statements - Multiple Branch Conditionals

Mary goes out and eats a few times a week. Depending on the day she wants to eat different things. Create a program for her that will check the  **day**  and set the  **answer**  variable to the type of food she would want to eat.

-   On  _Friday_, he likes to eat "Mexican".
-   On  _Saturday_, he likes to eat "Chinese".
-   On  _Sunday_, he likes to eat "American".
-   Outside those days, he likes "Eating In".

Run  `run-workflow step-03`  in your terminal to validate your work for step 3.

If all tests for the step are passing you will see  **BUILD SUCCESSFUL**  in your terminal window. If tests are failing you will see  **BUILD FAILED**  with the failing tests along with their messages in the output above.

You have completed this step when:

-   `run-workflow step-03`  passes with "BUILD SUCCESSFUL"

## Submitting your work

You can ensure all tests pass before submitting by clicking the  **Build**  button. You will see  **BUILD SUCCESSFUL**  in your terminal. If tests are failing you will see  **BUILD FAILED**  with the failing test output above.

You may also run  `run-workflow test-all`  to validate all steps are passing.

Click the  **Submit**  button to submit your work and review your grade.
