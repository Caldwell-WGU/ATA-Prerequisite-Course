## Basic requirements

For Step 8, you will implement some more functionality for the T-Shirt store. You will need knowledge from Module 10 of the prerequisites curriculum to do so.

For this step, use the end state class diagram to help you complete the step:

In this final step, you will do some refactoring and clean up.

Replace all string concatenations with  `StringBuilder`-based string construction and/or using  `String.format.`  Use the class diagram for the methods you should aim to create and use.

Clean up the  `Menu`  class. Extract long blocks of functionality into their own helper methods. Again, use the class diagram for the methods you should aim to create and use.

Implement an  `Enum`  for  `Menu`  selections to be used in the  `Menu`  class. Use the class diagram to help you code the class. Use this newly created enum to refactor how the menu selections work in the  `Menu`  class.

Run  `run-workflow step-08`  in your terminal to validate your work before submitting for final grading. If all tests for the step are passing you will see  **BUILD SUCCESSFUL**  in your terminal window. If tests are failing you will see  **BUILD FAILED**  with the failing tests along with their messages in the output above. You have completed this step when:

-   `run-workflow step-08`  passes with "BUILD SUCCESSFUL"
-   You have earned a point after submitting your work
