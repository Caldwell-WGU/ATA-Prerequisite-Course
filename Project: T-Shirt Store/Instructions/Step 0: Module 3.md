# Step 0 / Module 3

You may go back to the  [Main Prereqs Project Instructions](https://github.com/Caldwell-WGU/ATA-Prerequisite-Course/blob/main/Project:%20T-Shirt%20Store/Instructions/Main%20Prerequisite%20Project%20Instruction.md)  at any time.

## Basic requirements

For Step 0, your goal is to apply your lessons learned from Module 3’s topic called  **Version Control - Basic Git Commands**.

We have initialized a new git repository in the working folder of your project. The working folder is  `~/local`  and if you ever get lost in the terminal by navigating away from the working folder, you may always get back to your working folder by using  `cd ~/local`  in the terminal. As you learned in the Module 3 topic, always use the  `git status`  command to double-check what's happening with the git repo, to be sure you are in a good state to continue. In this case, here's what you should expect to see when you run  `git status`  on your first time interacting with the project, after we've initialized the repo:

In this step, you will create a new file with the filename  `step-zero-file.txt`  with the content  `Hello World from step-zero-file.txt`, stage those changes in the local git repository using the  `git add`command, commit those stages using  `git commit`, and push them to the remote repository we’ve set up for you with  `git push`.

You will receive your first  **point**  for this project by successfully completing this step.

Here are the specific instructions for this step:

-   Create a file called  `step-zero-file.txt`  in the  `src/main/resources`  directory.
-   Add the words  `Hello World from step-zero-file.txt`  to the above file.
-   Stage this file with the  `git add`  command.
-   Make sure you’ve successfully staged it using the  `git status`  command.
-   Commit the file using the  `git commit`  command. Give your commit a descriptive message.
-   Push the file to the repo we’ve set up for you using  `git push`.

__**You’ll need to continue to use basic git commands throughout the rest of the project to get credit for any of your work. The only code that will be graded for points will be code that is successfully staged, committed, and pushed to the remote repo.**__

Run  `run-workflow step-00`  in your terminal to validate your work before you move to step 1. If all tests for the step are passing you will see  **BUILD SUCCESSFUL**  in your terminal window. If tests are failing you will see  **BUILD FAILED**  with the failing tests along with their messages in the output above. You have completed this step when:

-   `run-workflow step-00`  passes with "BUILD SUCCESSFUL"
-   You have earned a point after submitting your work
